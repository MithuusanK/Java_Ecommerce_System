In my Assignment 2 I had completed all of Question 1,2, and 3 a) b) c).  With question 3 d), I had run into an error where it wouldnâ€™t read in the file no matter what I tried. I even attempted to run my code in terminal but I had run into the same error where the try catch had prevented me from inputting. I know my method to convert to map works however as it throws no errors. Also, when changing the name of the file the reader method is looking for to something else, the code executes and throws the file not found exception. When I get rid of the try catch however the code works and I am able to input and run my program.

In order to attempt and complete the other required tasks I had used the products array created already instead of the products.txt file and I converted all product info into a map. When I do this I am able to process all the methods such as print products, add to cart, remove from cart and add all products to a map. I also have added the stats function and I created a method that also prints my statistics. I also declared the map and created a method that utilized the comparator to sort the statistics. Unfortunately it did not work but I had created everything needed for it.
